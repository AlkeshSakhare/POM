SQL is a simple, yet powerful, language used to create, access, and manipulate data and structure in the database.

SQL Statements categories:
1.DDL - Data Definition Language.
2.DML - Data Manipulation Language.
3.DCL - Data Control Language.

-----------------------------------------------------DDL--------------------------------------------------------------------------
DDL - Data Definition Language
DDL is used to define, alter, or drop database objects and their privileges. DDL statements will implicitly perform a commit.

DDL Statements:
Create	It is used to create objects(tables, views) in the database.
Alter	It is used to alter the structure of the database objects.
Drop	delete database objects (It will invalidate the dependent objects ,it also drops indexes, triggers and referential integrity constraints ).
Truncate	remove all records from a table, including all spaces allocated for the records are removed (It is fast as compared to Delete and does not generate undo information as Delete does. It performs an implicit commit as it is a DDL. It resets the high water mark.)
Grant	assigning privileges
-----------------------------------------------------DML--------------------------------------------------------------------------
DML - Data Manipulation Language.
DML is used to access, create, modify or delete data in the structures of the database.

DML Statements:
Select	Select data from the database
Insert	It is used to insert data into a table
Update	It is used to update existing data within a table
Delete	It removes rows from the table.
-----------------------------------------------------DCL--------------------------------------------------------------------------

DCL - Data Control Language
Following are the examples of Data control Statements.
DCL Statements:
Commit	It will end the current transaction making the changes permanent and visible to all users..
Savepoint	It will identify a point(named SAVEPOINT) in a transaction to which you can later roll back
Rollback	It will undo all the changes made by the current transaction.
Set- Transaction	It is used to define the properties of a transaction.
